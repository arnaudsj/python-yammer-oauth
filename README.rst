A library for authorizing and accessing Yammer via OAuth.

Requires OAuth_ and, if using proxy, pycurl_.
.. _OAuth: http://code.google.com/p/oauth/
.. _pycurl: http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/

Note: The Yammer API methods seem to be designed for being used by users themselves rather than by bots. If your intention is to bring out material to, say, an intranet. Think carefully about how to do it in order not to expose sensitive information (e.g. direct messages, multiple networks)
